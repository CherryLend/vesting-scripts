# CherryLend Vesting Scripts

Vesting will begin in the 3 different categories. Combining development and team allocation, there are 11 million locked CHRY tokens.

- Milestone 1: Completion of lending, borrow, and liquidator code. This milestone has been completed and will unlock 1/6th of the allocation on November 15th daily. This means 1,833,333.33 CHRY will begin vesting daily over 2 years, approximately 2,511 CHRY each day.
- Milestone 2: V1 mainnet launch. This will unlock 3/6th (or half) of the vesting allocation daily and will begin vesting 3 months after our mainnet launch. For example, if we launch on October 1st, 3/6th of the teamâ€™s allocated tokens will begin vesting daily on January 1st, 2024.
- Milestone 3: V2 mainnet launch. This will unlock the final 2/6th of the token allocation and begin vesting 3 months after our mainnet is deployed. For example, if we launch v2 on March 2024, the remaining allocation will begin vesting June 2024.

All tokens are vested over 2 years.

* Milestones 2 and 3 will require changes to the scripts as dates are not defined at the moment.
